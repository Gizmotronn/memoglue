# MemoGlue
What if we could have an app that logged all of our connections & invitations without the limitations and social media aspects of Linkedin? MemoGlue is an experiment to create a native mobile application & companion web application to explore new, more efficient ways to maintain our social circles in a true 21st century user interface.

Currently just building this as an experiment but am extremely interested in turning this into a product that can bring in revenue
